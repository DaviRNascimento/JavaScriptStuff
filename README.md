# JavaScriptStuff
Inside this repositoty I will store important js files that, in my opinion, can help me some moment during my programmer life

I finished the HTML and CSS-Bootstrap module in my course and now I'll learn JS, a very famous and weird language;

Some import points I'd like to highlight for now are:
1 - Is a interpreted language: It means it's not necessary to use a compiler to run the js programs;
2 - A multiparadigm language, supporting OOL and also Procedural paradigms;
3 - A General Purpose Language, it means you can use JS to do a lot of things, such as games, web pages, server applications and so on;
4 - Easy to learn, weird to use: I personally dont like dynamics typed languages, but considering Im a open-minded person, i'll try.
5 - Very, very used. It speaks for itself.

Thats it, Thanks for read!
